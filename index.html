            <summary>Making Music</summary>
                <p>I enjoy making hip hop music. I recently took 
                a challenge to create music to help 1st graders learn in a more exciting way.
                I started making music as a bet with a friend of mines in my younger years.
                I ended up winning the bet which was that I could spit better rhymes than him.
                I enjoy everything from making the beats to editing the vocals.

            <summary>Playing Video Games</summary>
                <p>I have enjoyed playing video games since I was a youth. My older brother was the 
                orginator for this enjoyment. It started with the original nintendo and has lasted 
                all the way to the Playstation 4. I enjoy being able to be immeresed in a new
                enviornment. I also like the different challenges that would a rise in multiple 
                games I have played. I will make my own video game after I finish lc101 :-)!

            <summary>Bike Riding</summary>

                <p>When I discovered bike riding, I started to rediscover Saint Louis. I never knew 
                that there were so many bike trails throughout the city. I have noticed
                resturants and shops that if in my care I'd paid no attention to them. When I ride my
                bike I tend to destress and also discover. I have a hybrid road bike made by  
                Giant!

            <summary>Cooking Food</summary>
            
                <p>I love food! I cook food! My nickname on Snapchat is ChefJeff. The most challenging
                dish I have made was sushi. My favorite dish to make at the moment is turkey burgers.
                I am a great cook but I will burn a kitchen down if I try and bake.

            <summary>Watching Anime</summary>
            
                <p>Dragonball Z. I have watched every episode of this animie. Anime gives me a chance
                    to revisit my childhood. I enjoy the character development throughout the show. I like
                    anime because it is also almost like playing a video game, it allows my mind to take
                    a break from reality.
